## 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI)

This project focuses on building an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze **customer churn** in a telecom company. Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a service, and understanding it is crucial since retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

### 🔍 Project Objectives
- Load and clean raw data using **Power Query**
- Prepare and transform data for analysis in **Power BI**
- Create **KPIs** using card visuals
- Build common business charts (bar, pie, line)
- Write and understand basic **DAX measures**
- Add **slicers** for interactivity
- Design a clean, structured, and user-friendly dashboard
- Interpret and derive **business insights** from data

### ❓ Key Business Questions Answered
- How many customers have churned?
- Which subscription plans are more prone to churn?
- Does contract length influence customer behavior?
- How does customer spending vary across plans and demographics?

### 🧠 Outcome
By the end of this project, a **complete telecom churn dashboard** is created—similar to dashboards used by real-world analytics teams—making it ideal for **beginners** looking to gain hands-on experience with Power BI and business analytics.
